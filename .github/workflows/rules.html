				<h2>Rules</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>1250 points</li>
					<li>Rule of three (only three of the same unit/model)</li>
					<li>Woods are difficult terrain, but NOT dangerous terrain</li>
					<li>If the rules or FAQ doesn't cover it, use RAW - rules as written
						<ul>
							<li>Examples:
								<ul>
									<li>Steam tank: Can shoot with either weapon, but not both during the same shooting phase</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Chess clocks and timing</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Every player has 90 minutes per match (we use chess clocks/apps on the phone to keep track of the time spent)</li>
							<li>Once a player has spent his 90 minutes, the final score will be tilted one tier in the opponent's favor for each 10 minutes that player keeps playing in his turns.</li>
							<li>For example:
								<ul>
									<li>Player 1 plays against Player 2.</li>
									<li>Player 1 runs out of time, by spending a total of 90 minutes during his turns, indicated by his chess clock.</li>
									<li>In Player 1’s following turns, for each 15 minutes spent playing, the final score will go up by one tier in Player 2’s favor.</li>
									<li>If Player 1 has played 30 minutes in addition to his standard 90 minutes, and the score is 10-10 at the end of the battle, the actual score will be tilted in Player 2’s favor by 3 tiers, so the end result will be a 13-7 win to Player 2.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
